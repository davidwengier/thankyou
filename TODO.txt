- Melbshaker asks: "What happens if the contributor has already existed in the ReadMe file ?".
    - for now, we don't do anything: the contributor is already there.
    - in the future, maybe we can enhance it so the credit includes the suggestion/help they provided.
- Give the moderator an example if the error whisper to make it easy for them.
